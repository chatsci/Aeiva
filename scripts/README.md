# Scripts

In this folder, we put various util scripts that can be run directly as tools.

## Exporting the virtual environment

To export the virtual environment, run the following command:

```bash
./export_virtual_env.sh
```

This will create a file called `aeiva_environment.yml` in the root directory.

## Updating the git repository

To update the git repository, run the following command:

```bash
./update_git.sh
```

This will remove all the files that are currently being tracked by git and add them to the git index.
